![Amazing webpack starter project][1]

# A frontend starter that does not suck that much

Tired of alternatives I went on and built a simple webpack starter project that can be used to develop practically any frontend

## Provides

1. SASS/SCSS with modules
2. ES6 and Typescript
3. Webpack dev server

## Commands

* `yarn serve` will spawn a webpack-dev-server
* `yarn build` will produce a packaged version of the app in the `/dist` directory
